# LC3_v2

This project was created under the Deerfield Academy Computer Science department, Class Com 602 
with the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Bakker.

The implementation of the LC3 ("Little Computer 3") uses D-flip-flops which load the FSM on the rising 
edge of the clock and implement those changes to gates/components on the falling edge of the clock.
